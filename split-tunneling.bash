# Start torrent client by specifying the VPN and local IP addresses:
# rtorrent -b "${VPN_IFACE_ADDR}"
# Start deluge similarly:
# deluged --port=58846 --interface="${VPN_IFACE_ADDR}" --ui-interface="${LOCAL_IFACE_ADDR}"
# You probably also want to specify "--logfile=" somewhere so you can see if it has errors.
# If you have a lesser-privilged torrent user for your client, you can start that using sudo -u <USER> <COMMAND>:
# sudo -u my-deluge-user deluged --port=...
# sudo -u my-rtorrent-user rtorrent -b ...
# Good luck.
